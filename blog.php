It eventually was renamed as HCL Technologies Limited. Nadar established The Shiv Nadar Foundation in 1994 with the commitment of the creation of a more equitable, merit-based society by empowering individuals through transformational education to bridge the socio-economic divide. To that purpose, the Foundation has established institutions and programs in the underdeveloped disciplinary areas in India. Nadar has received several awards and accolades, including the Padma Bhushan in 2008, the third-highest civilian award, for his contribution to the IT industry. </p>
