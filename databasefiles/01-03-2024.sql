Particularly, since entrepreneurs\r\n        create jobs and start by creating a job for themselves.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Then we have mega-entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, and others who have\r\n        created millions of jobs. Nothing drives an economy like new job creation. It is really one of the best\r\n        things a person can do for others.\r\n    </p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<div class=\"centered\" style=\"text-align:center; align-items: center; width: 100%;height:auto; background-color:white;\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" src=\"/startUpSage/videos/course1.mp4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen  ></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Many people with good imaginations have a business idea or two in their heads that they want to act on when\r\n        “the time is right.” Usually, the right time is now.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        In fact, most successful entrepreneurs have a bias toward action. Procrastination is not an option. There\r\n        will be failures along the way, of course. In Silicon Valley, a popular expression is, “Fail early and\r\n        often.” The key is to learn from mistakes and to have advisers who can give you the benefit of their\r\n        experiences. If you are open to advice, you can reduce the number of mistakes made and the scale of the ones\r\n        that do occur. Get some good and trusted advisors to comment on your ideas. But above all, you should take\r\n        action. Time waits for no one.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><br><br>\r\n        <b style=\"color: #0c047c; font-size:25px;\">What is Entrepreneurship Education?</b>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <b style=\"color: #0c047c; font-size:25px;\">How do you learn to be an entrepreneur?</b>\r\n<br> If you are a first-time entrepreneur, you will likely benefit from\r\n        some training in entrepreneurship.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        There are some basics in business that you need to understand, including the fundamentals of marketing,\r\n        accounting, finance, operations, HR, and finance. A course in entrepreneurship can help you create a\r\n        business plan. This plan can account for each of these basic business functions for your proposed startup.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        To learn entrepreneurship is to take a mini-course in business. After all, there is more to entrepreneurship\r\n        than a business plan. The four basic functions of management are:<br>1) planning,<br> 2) organizing, <br>3) leading,<br>\r\n        4) controlling. <br><br>Each of these functions must be carefully considered in launching a business startup.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Most important for entrepreneurship is to develop a way of operating that moves the ball forward. If you are\r\n        passionate about your business idea, it will be easy to sustain momentum toward your goal of a completed\r\n        startup.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        You need to be focused and to have a sense of urgency. The competition out there is trying to beat you since\r\n        business is a competitive game. However, as with all games, it should be fun—and will be if you are a good\r\n        player and the game is fair.\r\n    </p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n    <center>\r\n        <img src=\"/StartUpSage/img/course1img1.jpg\" alt=\"Entrepreneurship Image\" class=\"entrepreneurship-image\">\r\n    </center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b style=\"color: #0c047c; font-size:25px;\">How Can I Find Entrepreneurship Training?</b>\r\n        <br>\r\n        How can you get the entrepreneurial education and coaching to succeed at creating a new venture?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        First, find a college or university that offers a hands-on program for learning entrepreneurship and that\r\n        teaches business basics and guides you in developing a good business plan.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Then, locate mentors who have been through the startup process, and you will be ahead of the game. The\r\n        mentors will be your coaches. I’ve known entrepreneurs who created a board of directors before they were\r\n        incorporated in order to have the advisors readily available during the startup phase. Often, they are\r\n        friends or business associates who serve as advisors, frequently on a pro bono basis during the startup\r\n        phase.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        At Elmhurst University, we have several available sources of advice, including a local incubator and\r\n        accelerator, and an entrepreneurship mentoring program.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        What is remarkable about entrepreneurs, especially serial entrepreneurs, is their willingness and enthusiasm\r\n        for helping first-timers learn entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs are exceptionally supportive and generous\r\n        people as a rule. I strongly recommend that you find mentors for your entrepreneurship journey.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        There are usually a number of things you will encounter that they have already experienced, and they can\r\n        advise you how to be prepared to deal with the inevitable speed bumps on the road up ahead.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Starting a business can be a challenge and you shouldn’t and needn’t go it alone. If you have a proprietary\r\n        idea, you should ask anyone with whom you share your confidential data to sign a simple confidentiality\r\n        agreement. (Examples can readily be found online). They should respect your professionalism in requesting\r\n        that courtesy.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"advertisement-container\">\r\n  <div class=\"advertisement-label\"><u>Advertisement</u></div>\r\n<br>\r\n  <img class=\"advertisement-image\" src=\"/StartUpSage/img/banner/Ad1.jpg\" alt=\"Advertisement\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br><br>\r\n        <b style=\"color: #0c047c; font-size:25px;\">Why Should I Be an Entrepreneur?</b>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Most entrepreneurs will tell you that the creativity involved in launching a startup is a highly rewarding\r\n        experience.

There are a lot of people willing to provide assistance, and I include\r\n        myself among them.
